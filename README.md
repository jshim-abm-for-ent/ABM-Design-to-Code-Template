# ABM-Canvas-Toolkit

A structured and practical toolkit for designing Agent-Based Models (ABMs) using a clear, reproducible, and research-oriented **ABM Canvas** framework.  
This repository provides **ABM Canvas 2.0**, example templates, and optional scripts for converting structured design specifications into NetLogo model components.

## 🚀 Overview

Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) often requires translating conceptual model designs into executable code while maintaining clarity, reproducibility, and transparency.  
**ABM Canvas Toolkit** helps streamline this process by providing:

- A formalized **ABM Canvas (version 2.0)**  
- Example templates for design documentation  
- A clean directory structure for organizing models  
- (Optional) Scripts for generating NetLogo `.nls` and `.nlogox` files from Canvas text  
- A foundation for ABM education, research, and collaborative modeling projects

## 🧩 ABM Canvas 2.0

**ABM Canvas 2.0** is a structured design template that organizes essential ABM components into clear sections, enabling reproducible documentation and consistent model development.

Canvas 2.0 consists of **10 major sections**:

1. Research question & simulation purpose  
2. Agent breeds & attributes  
3. Environment & constraints  
4. Process overview & scheduling  
5. Behavioral rules  
6. Interaction rules  
7. Initialization (`setup`)  
8. Parameters (sliders, switches, globals)  
9. Evaluation metrics (plots, monitors, logging)  
10. Experiment design (manual scenarios + BehaviorSpace)

📄 The full template is available at:  
**[`/templates/ABM_Canvas_2.0.md`](/templates/ABM_Canvas_2.0.md)**

## 🎓 Use Cases

### ✔ Research  
Use the Canvas to document model mechanisms for papers, supplementary materials, or replication packages.

### ✔ Education  
Students can design ABMs without immediately writing code — Canvas acts as a conceptual bridge between idea and implementation.

### ✔ Collaboration  
Common structure promotes alignment between researchers, developers, and domain experts.
