## ABM Canvas 2.0

**ABM Canvas 2.0** is an enhanced and more structured version of the original ABM design template.  
It helps researchers, students, and practitioners specify Agent-Based Models in a clear and consistent manner by organizing all essential elements required for model construction.

Canvas 2.0 is composed of **10 well-defined sections**, enabling transparent model documentation and reproducible model design:

- **Research question and simulation purpose**
- **Agent breeds and their attributes**
- **Environment configuration and constraints**
- **Process overview and execution scheduling**
- **Behavioral rules and decision mechanisms**
- **Interaction rules between agents**
- **Initialization logic for the `setup` phase**
- **Parameter definitions** (sliders, switches, globals)
- **Evaluation metrics** (plots, monitors, logging)
- **Experiment design**, including manual scenarios and BehaviorSpace specification
